Once again, ADN is hosting a survey to identify the Civil 3D API features 
important to you. We take very seriously your feedback, and if you review past 
survey results with the API functionality we have implemented, you’ll notice 
they match very well.

Don’t let go this opportunity to be heard. Take the survey and let us know which 
areas we need to work on to improve the API. You can take the survey 
[here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Civil3DAPIWishListSurveyY2013).
