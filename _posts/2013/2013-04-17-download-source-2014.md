This is a quick post to inform you that the Civilized Development source has 
been ported to the Civil 3D 2014 release. No additional samples have been added; 
we will do that in upcoming posts, but you should be able to build and run the 
samples against the new version of Civil 3D. You can download the source from 
the [Civilized Development Repository](https://bitbucket.org/IsaacRodriguez/civilizeddevelopment).
