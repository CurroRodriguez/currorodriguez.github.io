You go on vacation for a couple of weeks and all of the sudden Civil 3D 2014 is 
out the door and everyone has beat you to talk about it. It has been a very long 
time since my last post. As you can imagine, my team and I were very busy 
working on our new release, and that left me very little time to write new posts. 
Now, the release is out the door and it is full of new features and functionality 
that I will be writing about in the upcoming weeks.

Unfortunately, this year I cannot commit to a long series of posts covering each 
and every piece that it is new in this release. Last year, it took quite a while 
to go over all the functionality and work always gets in the way. I’m, therefore, 
concentrating in the pieces that are more important to you, so do not hesitate 
to contact me requesting topics for discussion.

If you want to have a sneak-peak of what’s new in the AutoCAD Civil 3D 2014 API, 
you can check the 
[Infrastructure Modeling DevBlog](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/2013/03/whats-new-in-autocad-civil-3d-2014-api.html), 
which already covers the new 
features. Between them covering very important aspects of the API and myself 
giving a more in-depth overview of the feature, we are set to provide you with 
all the information you need to use the new APIs. So stay tuned because there is 
a lot of information coming your way.
