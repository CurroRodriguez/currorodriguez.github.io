I’m writing this post on my way to AU 2013, and hopefully, it will be posted 
before I get to my first layover in Chicago. Although your flying experience 
will vary depending on airline and destination, this particular flight has 
on-board WiFi and so does my next one to Las Vegas.

The “Cloud” seems to be be available everywhere these days, which is one of the 
reasons why this year, if you are attending AU in person or on-line, you’ll see 
there is a myriad of sessions around Autodesk “Cloud” services, and many 
development classes targeted to Web-Services.

Connectivity is a reality. Even if it is not widely available in your area, it 
will get there soon. And it will bring all sorts of opportunities for your 
business and applications.

I admit; I was skeptical. In the past year, I’ve been transitioning to the 
“Cloud” in most of my personal computing and a big chunk of my professional one. 
I wanted to experience what all the fuss was about, and I got to say, I’ve never 
been happier. 

There was one thing though, I didn’t fully transition; my work e-mail archive. 
Years of e-mail were stored locally in a single machine the old Outlook way, and 
guess what; my laptop died beyond repair, and now I’m hoping IT can rescue all 
that e-mail. Let me tell you, lesson learned. All my e-mail, including my 
archives, is now on-line, and I trust my IT department to keep it safe from 
hardware failures.

I will be writing more about “Cloud” services in the near future. For now, I 
leave you with this post from the “Clouds” on my way to AU.
