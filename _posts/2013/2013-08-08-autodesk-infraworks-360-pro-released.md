It has been a long time, but I am taking a small break from my busy small 
schedule to write about the official release of a new service from Autodesk. 
Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro debuted today in what is another piece of Autodesk’s 
cloud strategy.

Paul McRoberts, vice president of Autodesk’s Infrastructure Business, talked 
this week about the company’s announcement today of Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro. 
The announcement state:

> Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro offers the latest 3D modeling, visualization and 
cloud-based collaboration technologies to help efficiently close the estimated 
$30 trillion gap worldwide between desperately needed infrastructure and the 
funding required to deliver it.

As you might have already seen, Autodesk is investing heavily in the “Cloud” and 
this release is a key piece of the puzzle. Regarding price and availability, the 
announcement says:

> Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro will be available in this month for purchase on a 
quarterly basis, which includes 150 cloud credits (units of measurement to 
perform tasks such as rendering or a simulation in 
[Autodesk 360](https://360.autodesk.com/landing)). To accommodate 
long or short project needs, users have the flexibility to renew at the end of 
each quarter. Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro will be available in English and other 
languages, and is available worldwide in countries where electronic license 
downloads of Autodesk products are permitted. See details and purchasing options 
at [http://www.autodesk.com/infraworks](http://www.autodesk.com/infraworks).

I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the team for the release. It has 
been a huge effort that it is finally coming to fruition. Now, it is time for me 
to go back to work.
