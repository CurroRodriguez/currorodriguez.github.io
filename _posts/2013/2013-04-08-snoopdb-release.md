Good news if you have updated to Civil 3D 2014. Augusto Goncalves has updated his 
magnificent tool SnoopDB to work with the 2014 release. The tool adds some new 
functionality allowing to access all the properties exposed by the new Corridor 
API, as well as support for Point Groups. The main new feature is the ability to 
navigate from one entity to another by clicking a related property.

This tool is very handy to analyze the structure of your Civil drawings, and it 
comes very handy to troubleshoot issues and find information that it is not 
immediately visible in the drawing. Download the 
[tool](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/files/snoopcivil3d_executable.zip) and 
[source code](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/files/snoopcivil3d_sourcecode.zip), 
and check [Augustoâ€™s article](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/2013/04/snoop-civil-3d-2014-database.html) 
for more information.
