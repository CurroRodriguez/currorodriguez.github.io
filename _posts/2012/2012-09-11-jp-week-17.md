Most of the time when working with contours, we want to work with a range 
starting at some elevation, ending at some other elevation, and using a specific 
interval. Fortunately, the API provides this functionality through overloaded 
`ExtractContours()` methods.

The first overload take an elevation interval. The range is created starting at 
the surface's minimum elevation and ending at its maximum elevation. These two 
values are determined by the `GeneralSurfaceProperties` of the surface object. 
As we can see in the following example, it is very simple to create contours at 
a specified interval.

**C#**

```csharp
[CommandMethod("CDS_ExtractSurfaceContoursAtInterval")]
public void CDS_ExtractSurfaceContoursAtInterval()
{
  using (Transaction tr = startTransaction())
  {
    ITerrainSurface surface = getSurface() as ITerrainSurface;
    if (surface == null) return;

    double interval = getDouble("interval");
    if (Double.IsNaN(interval)) return;

    ObjectIdCollection contours =
      surface.ExtractContours(interval);

    customizeContours(contours, _intervalContoursColor);

    tr.Commit();
  }
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
<CommandMethod("CDS_ExtractSurfaceContoursAtInterval")> _
Public Sub CDS_ExtractSurfaceContoursAtInterval()
  Using tr As Transaction = startTransaction()
    Dim surface As ITerrainSurface = TryCast(getSurface(), 
      ITerrainSurface)
    If surface Is Nothing Then
      Return
    End If

    Dim interval As Double = getDouble("interval")
    If [Double].IsNaN(interval) Then
      Return
    End If

    Dim contours As ObjectIdCollection = surface.ExtractContours(
      interval)

    customizeContours(contours, _intervalContoursColor)

    tr.Commit()
  End Using
End Sub
```

We can further customize the behavior by specifying the minimum and maximum 
elevation to utilize together with the interval. This other example does just 
that.

**C#**

```csharp
[CommandMethod("CDS_ExtractSurfaceContoursFromToElevationRange")]
public void CDS_ExtractSurfaceContoursFromToElevationRange()
{
  using (Transaction tr = startTransaction())
  {
    ITerrainSurface surface = getSurface() as ITerrainSurface;
    if (surface == null) return;
                
    double minElevation = getDouble("minimum elevation");
    if (Double.IsNaN(minElevation)) return;

    double maxElevation = getDouble("maximum elevation");
    if (Double.IsNaN(maxElevation)) return;

    double interval = getDouble("interval");
    if (Double.IsNaN(interval)) return;

    ObjectIdCollection contours =
      surface.ExtractContours(
        minElevation, maxElevation, interval);

    customizeContours(contours, _rangedContoursColor);
                    
    tr.Commit();
  }
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
<CommandMethod("CDS_ExtractSurfaceContoursFromToElevationRange")> _
Public Sub CDS_ExtractSurfaceContoursFromToElevationRange()
  Using tr As Transaction = startTransaction()
    Dim surface As ITerrainSurface = TryCast(getSurface(), 
      ITerrainSurface)
    If surface Is Nothing Then
      Return
    End If

    Dim minElevation As Double = getDouble("minimum elevation")
    If [Double].IsNaN(minElevation) Then
      Return
    End If

    Dim maxElevation As Double = getDouble("maximum elevation")
    If [Double].IsNaN(maxElevation) Then
      Return
    End If

    Dim interval As Double = getDouble("interval")
    If [Double].IsNaN(interval) Then
      Return
    End If

    Dim contours As ObjectIdCollection = surface.ExtractContours(
      minElevation, maxElevation, interval)

    customizeContours(contours, _rangedContoursColor)

    tr.Commit()
  End Using
End Sub
```

As you can see, these methods are implemented as part of the `ITerrainSurface` 
interface, which means they can be used with TIN and Grid surfaces, The 
`ExtractContours()` methods provide great flexibility to extract contour 
information from a surface, and their functionality is what most users require. 
Next week, we will take a look at an even more flexible method provided by 
`ITerrainSurface`.

examples. I recommend you download the latest source from the
