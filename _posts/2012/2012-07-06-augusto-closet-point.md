Time flies when you are busy, and this week between holidays and all the work we 
are doing, I didn't have much time to work on the installment of the 
“21 Weeks of Jay Peak”. Still, I didn’t want to let the week go by without some 
good material. Thankfully, Augusto came up with a great 
[article](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/2012/07/find-closest-point-on-tinsurface.html) 
that demonstrates how to find the closest point in a Surface to another point 
outside of the Surface.

It seems that some of you have asked about this in the past, and now it is a 
good chance to take a look at Augusto's post about it. Always good stuff coming 
from those ADN guys.
