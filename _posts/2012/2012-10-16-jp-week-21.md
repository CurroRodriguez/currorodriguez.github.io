In Jay Peak, we have provided the ability to create stacked profile views 
through the API. We did this by providing new overloads to the already existing 
methods that created profile views. The `ProfileView` class exposes several 
`Create()` and, as we saw last week, `CreateMultiple()` methods to create single 
and multiple profile views. We also provided overloads for these methods that 
take a `StackedProfileViewsCreationOptions` object, which defines how stacked 
profiles can be created.

The following example uses some of the code from last week to create multiple 
stacked profiles:

**C#**

```csharp
private void createStackedProfileViews()
{
  ProfileView.CreateMultiple(_alignmentId, _insertionPoint, 
      _stackedOptions, _creationOptions);
}

private StackedProfileViewsCreationOptions _stackedOptions
{
  get
  {
    StackedProfileViewsCreationOptions options =
      new StackedProfileViewsCreationOptions(_defaultPVId,
        _defaultPVId, _defaultPVId);
    return options;
  }
}

private ObjectId _defaultPVId
{
  get
  {
    return _civildoc.Styles.ProfileViewStyles[0];
  }
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
Private Sub createStackedProfileViews()
  ProfileView.CreateMultiple(_alignmentId, _insertionPoint,
    _stackedOptions, _creationOptions)
End Sub

Private ReadOnly Property _stackedOptions() _
    As StackedProfileViewsCreationOptions
  Get
    Dim options As New StackedProfileViewsCreationOptions(
      _defaultPVId, _defaultPVId, _defaultPVId)
    Return options
  End Get
End Property

Private ReadOnly Property _defaultPVId() As ObjectId
  Get
    Return _civildoc.Styles.ProfileViewStyles(0)
  End Get
End Property
```

And with this installment, we complete the Jay Peak series. It has been many 
weeks of Jay Peak goodness, which I hope you have enjoyed and that allows you to 
derive great benefit from our latest release. The series has covered the most 
important features and enhancements we added, but there are some other gems that 
we will be looking at in the future, so stay tuned for more Civil 3D API talk.
