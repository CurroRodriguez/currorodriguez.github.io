User defined properties allows us to store additional information about a COGO 
point. In this post, I will demonstrate how you can define new properties that 
then can be assigned to a point and set their value. The process is simple and 
gives you great flexibility on the type of the properties you can create. Let's 
start by looking at the “demo” command I created.

**C#**

```csharp
[CommandMethod("CDS_UDPDemo")]
public void CDS_UDPDemo()
{
  createDemoPointsRepresentingWells();
  createDemoProperties();
  createDemoPointGroup();
  setDemoPointProperties();
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
<CommandMethod("CDS_UDPDemo")> _
Public Sub CDS_UDPDemo()
  createDemoPointsRepresentingWells()
  createDemoProperties()
  createDemoPointGroup()
  setDemoPointProperties()
End Sub
```

The command is very simple. We first create some points to represent “Wells”. 
Then, we create the custom properties (User Defined Properties/UDPs). Finally, 
we create a point group to include our points and show the properties, and we 
set their values in the point objects themselves. I will not spend time 
explaining how to create the points and point groups, since I already talk about 
it in [Cogo Point Basics](needs-link) and [Point Groups](needs-link). 
But it is important to understand that 
UDP classifications, which group properties, are applied to point groups, and 
you need to specify the classification to use by calling the 
`UseCustomClassification()` method of the point group object. As always, you can 
download the entire source code from the 
[Civilized Development](https://bitbucket.org/softempire/civilizeddevelopment) 
repository at Bitbucket.

### Creating a UDP Classification

The first thing that you need is a “classification” to group the properties. 
Maybe, there are already classifications available in the drawing you are 
working on, but in general, you will want to create your own classifications for 
your UDPs you create. It is also a good idea to create your own point groups to 
display the properties. Creating a classification is very simple, as you can 
see in the following code.

**C#**

```csharp
private UDPClassification createClassification(string name)
{
  UDPClassificationCollection classifications =
    UDPClassificationCollection
    .GetPointUDPClassifications(_database);
  return classifications.Add(name);
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
Private Function createClassification(name As String) As UDPClassification
  Dim classifications As UDPClassificationCollection =
    UDPClassificationCollection.GetPointUDPClassifications(_database)
  Return classifications.Add(name)
End Function
```

We access the classifications collection through the static method 
`GetPointUDPClassifications()` in the `UDPClassficationCollection` class, which 
takes an instance of the `Database`. The `UDPClassificationCollection` exposes 
an interface to access and manipulate all the classifications in the drawing, as 
well as creating new ones. Classifications are created by name, and the `Add()` 
method throws an exception if the specified name already exists. You can avoid 
the exception by calling `Contains()` to check for the existence of a 
classification with the specified name.

### Creating User Defined Properties

Creating a UDP involves two steps. First, we need to create a type information 
for the UDP, which defines the type and values that are accepted. Then, you 
create the UDP through the `UDPClassification` object using the type 
information. The following examples demonstrate how to create the different type 
information objects that are supported by the API.

**C#**

```csharp
private AttributeTypeInfoBool makeBoolDefinition(
  string name, string description)
{
  AttributeTypeInfoBool definition = new AttributeTypeInfoBool(name);
  definition.Description = description;
  definition.DefaultValue = false;
  definition.UseDefaultValue = true;
  return definition;
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
Private Function makeBoolDefinition(name As String, description As String) _
    As AttributeTypeInfoBool

  Dim definition As New AttributeTypeInfoBool(name)
  definition.Description = description
  definition.DefaultValue = False
  definition.UseDefaultValue = True
  Return definition
End Function
```

To define a boolean value, we use the `AttributeTypeInfoBool` class. This class, 
like other type information classes, allows you to specify a “name” for the 
property and a description. It also allows you to specify the default value of 
the property (the value to which the property is set if it is not specified) and 
whether the value should be used or not. Most of the time, you will want to 
specify the default value and set the ‘UseDefaultValue’ to true to insure the 
property is properly initialized.

**C#**

```csharp
private AttributeTypeInfoString makeStringDefinition(
  string name, string description)
{
  AttributeTypeInfoString definition = 
    new AttributeTypeInfoString(name);
  definition.Description = description;
  definition.DefaultValue = String.Empty;
  definition.UseDefaultValue = true;
  return definition;
}

```

**VB.NET**

```vb
Private Function makeStringDefinition(name As String,
    description As String) As AttributeTypeInfoString

  Dim definition As New AttributeTypeInfoString(name)
  definition.Description = description
  definition.DefaultValue = [String].Empty
  definition.UseDefaultValue = True
  Return definition
End Function
```

String properties are similar to booleans. You defined them through the 
`AttributeTypeInfoString` class, and you must specify the “name”. You can also 
specify a description for the property. The string type information also allows 
you to set the default value and specify whether it should be used, which you 
should use it to insure proper initialization.

**C#**

```csharp
private AttributeTypeInfoEnum makeEnumDefinition(
  string name, string description)
{
  EnumDefinition valueDefinitions = new EnumDefinition();
  AttributeTypeInfoEnum definition = 
    new AttributeTypeInfoEnum(name, valueDefinitions.Values);
  definition.Description = description;
  definition.DefaultValue = valueDefinitions.DefaultValue;
  definition.UseDefaultValue = true;
  return definition;
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
Private Function makeEnumDefinition(name As String,
    description As String) As AttributeTypeInfoEnum

  Dim valueDefinitions As New EnumDefinition()
  Dim definition As New AttributeTypeInfoEnum(name, 
    valueDefinitions.Values)
  definition.Description = description
  definition.DefaultValue = valueDefinitions.DefaultValue
  definition.UseDefaultValue = True
  Return definition
End Function
```

You can create UDPs that work as enumerations (enums). The values supported by 
the enumeration are strings, and should be specified by an 
`IEnumerable<string>`. You can also set the its default, which must be one of 
the supported values and whether the default value should be used.

**C#**

```csharp
private AttributeTypeInfoInt makeIntDefinition(
  string name, string description)
{
  AttributeTypeInfoInt definition = new AttributeTypeInfoInt(name);
  definition.Description = description;
  definition.DefaultValue = 0;
  definition.LowerBoundValue = Int32.MinValue;
  definition.LowerBoundInclusive = true;
  definition.UpperBoundValue = Int32.MaxValue;
  definition.UpperBoundInclusive = true;
  definition.UseDefaultValue = true;
  return definition;
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
Private Function makeIntDefinition(name As String, description As String) _
    As AttributeTypeInfoInt

  Dim definition As New AttributeTypeInfoInt(name)
  definition.Description = description
  definition.DefaultValue = 0
  definition.LowerBoundValue = Int32.MinValue
  definition.LowerBoundInclusive = True
  definition.UpperBoundValue = Int32.MaxValue
  definition.UpperBoundInclusive = True
  definition.UseDefaultValue = True
  Return definition
End Function
```

Integer properties are defined by the `AttributeTypeInfoInt` class. You must 
specify a “name”, and you can specify a “description”, “default value”, and 
whether the default value should be used. But, it also allows you to specify a 
minimum and maximum value for the property, and whether those values are 
included (accepted). Basically, the `AttributeTypeInfoInt` allows you to 
specified a valid range of values for the property.

**C#**

```csharp
private AttributeTypeInfoDouble makeDoubleDefinition(
  string name, string description)
{
  AttributeTypeInfoDouble definition =
    new AttributeTypeInfoDouble(name);
  definition.Description = description;
  definition.DefaultValue = 0.0;
  definition.UseDefaultValue = true;
  definition.LowerBoundValue = 0.0;
  definition.LowerBoundInclusive = true;
  definition.UpperBoundValue = Double.MaxValue;
  definition.UpperBoundInclusive = true;
  definition.UseDefaultValue = true;
  definition.DataType = AttributeTypeInfoDoubleDataType.Percent;
  return definition;
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
Private Function makeDoubleDefinition(name As String,
    description As String) As AttributeTypeInfoDouble

  Dim definition As New AttributeTypeInfoDouble(name)
  definition.Description = description
  definition.DefaultValue = 0.0
  definition.UseDefaultValue = True
  definition.LowerBoundValue = 0.0
  definition.LowerBoundInclusive = True
  definition.UpperBoundValue = [Double].MaxValue
  definition.UpperBoundInclusive = True
  definition.UseDefaultValue = True
  definition.DataType = AttributeTypeInfoDoubleDataType.Percent
  Return definition
End Function
```

You can also create properties that store a double value. You use the 
`AttributeTypeInfoDouble` class to define the property, which exposes a similar 
interface to that of integers. Double properties, however, are more flexible 
because they also allow you to specify what the value represents. The 
`AttributeTypeInfoDouble` class exposes a `DataType` property, which takes a 
value from the `AttributeTypeInfoDoubleDataType` enumeration, and it will 
represent the value according to the value set. If you don't specify the 
`DataType` property, the value will be interpreted as a plain double, but you 
can also represent it as any of the types in the enumeration (angle, direction, 
coordinate, rotation, among others). This give you a lot of flexibility to 
represent different properties of a point. In the example above, we represent 
the double as a percentage.

Once you created your UDP definition (type information), you can use it to add 
the property to a classification, as demonstrated in the following example.

**C#**

```csharp
private void addUDPs(UDPClassification classification)
{
  _potable = classification.CreateUDP(makeBoolDefinition("Potable", 
    "Indicates if water is suitable for consumption."));
  _chloride = classification.CreateUDP(makeIntDefinition("Chloride", 
    "Amount of chloride (mg/l)."));
  _laboratory = classification.CreateUDP(
    makeStringDefinition("Laboratory", 
    "Name of the laboratory that performed analysis."));
  _hardness = classification.CreateUDP(makeEnumDefinition("Hardness", 
    "Hardness with respect to anions in metallic cations."));
  _alkalinity = classification.CreateUDP(
    makeDoubleDefinition("Alkalinity", 
    "Ability to resist sudden changes in pH."));
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
Private Sub addUDPs(classification As UDPClassification)
  _potable = classification.CreateUDP(
    makeBoolDefinition("Potable",
    "Indicates if water is suitable for consumption."))
  _chloride = classification.CreateUDP(
    makeIntDefinition("Chloride", "Amount of chloride (mg/l)."))
  _laboratory = classification.CreateUDP(
    makeStringDefinition("Laboratory",
    "Name of the laboratory that performed analysis."))
  _hardness = classification.CreateUDP(
    makeEnumDefinition("Hardness",
    "Hardness with respect to anions in metallic cations."))
  _alkalinity = classification.CreateUDP(
    makeDoubleDefinition("Alkalinity",
    "Ability to resist sudden changes in pH."))
End Sub
```

### Setting a UDP in a COGO Point

To set a property, you call the `SetUDPValue()` method of `CogoPoint`, 
specifying the UDP you want to set and its value.The following example shows how 
to do this.

**C#**

```csharp
private void customizePoint(ObjectId id)
{
  CogoPoint point = id.GetObject(OpenMode.ForWrite) as CogoPoint;
  point.SetUDPValue(_potable, true);
  point.SetUDPValue(_chloride, 150);
  point.SetUDPValue(_laboratory, "CivilDev Labs, Inc.");
  point.SetUDPValue(_hardness, "Carbonate (Temporary)");
  point.SetUDPValue(_alkalinity, 7.5);
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
Private Sub customizePoint(id As ObjectId)
  Dim point As CogoPoint = TryCast(id.GetObject(OpenMode.ForWrite), 
    CogoPoint)
  point.SetUDPValue(_potable, True)
  point.SetUDPValue(_chloride, 150)
  point.SetUDPValue(_laboratory, "CivilDev Labs, Inc.")
  point.SetUDPValue(_hardness, "Carbonate (Temporary)")
  point.SetUDPValue(_alkalinity, 7.5)
End Sub
```

The COM API has a “bug” where if the property you are trying to set is not part 
of a classification applied to a point group containing the point, the call will 
fail. I thought I blog about this issue in the past, but I cannot find the post, 
so maybe I didn't. The problem was caused by some validation code that was added 
for the UI, and which does not apply to the API but was being reused.

Through the UI, you will only see properties in classifications that are applied 
to a point group. Your options are to apply all the classifications, none of 
them, or apply a specific one, and the UI will show properties from those 
classifications

However, the properties and their values apply to COGO Points, so you should be 
able to set an existing UDP to any point. You will not be able to see the 
property or its value in the UI if it doesn’t meet the requirements above, but 
you should be able to retrieve them and manipulate them through the API. We 
insured the correct behavior was implemented in the .NET API, so any workarounds 
you have used in the past with COM should not be necessary.
