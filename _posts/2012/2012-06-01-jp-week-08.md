This week is the turn to talk about description keys. As most of you know, 
description keys are a powerful concept in Civil 3D that allow users to control 
certain aspects of the representation of COGO points. To understand description 
keys, let’s first talk about some of the properties of the COGO point object.

COGO points contain a “raw description”, which embeds information about a 
specific point. You can specify a “description format” that allows you to format 
the “raw description” into a more readable string called “full description. All 
these properties can be specified in a per point basis, but if you think about 
how some drawings may contain thousands or millions of points, you can see that 
managing these properties per point is almost impossible.

To simplify the task, Civil 3D has the concept of description keys. The 
description keys match their code to the point description and override 
properties in the COGO point with those defined in the description key. Even 
more power is provided because description keys are part of a description key 
set, which allows you to group them and create some kind of standard. But I am 
probably telling you things that you already know as a user of Civil 3D, and 
what I really want to talk about is how to use these description keys through 
the API.

### Creating Description Keys

First, I want to show you how to create some description keys, and then we will 
add some points to match them. I will start with a simple command that creates a 
description key set “CivilDev” and adds a couple of keys. The command looks like 
this:

**C#**

```csharp
[CommandMethod("CDS_CreateCivilDevDescriptionKeys")]
public void CDS_CreateCivilDevDescriptionKeys()
{
  using (Transaction tr = startTransaction())
  {
    ObjectId keySetId = createOrRetrieveDescriptionKeySet("CivilDev");
    PointDescriptionKeySet keySet = 
      keySetId.GetObject(OpenMode.ForWrite) 
      as PointDescriptionKeySet;

    ObjectId treesKeyId = createDescriptionKey(keySet, "TREE");
    PointDescriptionKey key = 
      treesKeyId.GetObject(OpenMode.ForWrite) 
      as PointDescriptionKey;
    customizeDescriptionKey(key, "Tree", "Description Only",
      "$0 is a $1");

    ObjectId wellsKeyId = createDescriptionKey(keySet, "WELL");
    key = wellsKeyId.GetObject(OpenMode.ForWrite) 
      as PointDescriptionKey;
    customizeDescriptionKey(key, "Well", "Point Number Only",
      "The $0 is $1");

    tr.Commit();
  }
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
<CommandMethod("CDS_CreateCivilDevDescriptionKeys")> _
Public Sub CDS_CreateCivilDevDescriptionKeys()
  Using tr As Transaction = startTransaction()
    Dim keySetId As ObjectId =
      createOrRetrieveDescriptionKeySet("CivilDev")
    Dim keySet As PointDescriptionKeySet =
      TryCast(keySetId.GetObject(OpenMode.ForWrite), 
      PointDescriptionKeySet)

    Dim treesKeyId As ObjectId = createDescriptionKey(keySet, "TREE")
    Dim key As PointDescriptionKey =
      TryCast(treesKeyId.GetObject(OpenMode.ForWrite), 
        PointDescriptionKey)
    customizeDescriptionKey(key, "Tree", "Description Only", "$0 is a $1")

    Dim wellsKeyId As ObjectId = createDescriptionKey(keySet, "WELL")
    key =
      TryCast(wellsKeyId.GetObject(OpenMode.ForWrite), 
        PointDescriptionKey)
    customizeDescriptionKey(key,
      "Well", "Point Number Only", "The $0 is $1")

    tr.Commit()
  End Using
End Sub
```

The command first creates a description key set named “CivilDev”. Then, it uses 
it to add a couple of keys to represents trees (TREE) and wells (WELL). We 
customize the keys by passing the point style, label style and description format 
we want to use.

The process of creating a description key set is very simple. The Civil 3D API 
contains a `PointDescriptionKeySetCollection` class, which exposes a static 
`GetPointDescriptionKeySets()` method that takes the `Database` object from 
where to retrieve the collection. Once we have the collection, we just need to 
create a new one by calling the ‘Add()’ method and passing it a name. Needless 
to say that the name should not exist, so you want to check for its existence 
before creating it. In this case, we return the existing set if it already 
exists.

**C#**

```csharp
private ObjectId createOrRetrieveDescriptionKeySet(string name)
{
  PointDescriptionKeySetCollection keySets =
    PointDescriptionKeySetCollection
      .GetPointDescriptionKeySets(_database);
  if (keySets.Contains(name))
  {
    return keySets[name];
  }
  return keySets.Add(name);
}
```

**VB>NET**

```vb
Private Function createOrRetrieveDescriptionKeySet(name As String) _
    As ObjectId
  Dim keySets As PointDescriptionKeySetCollection =
    PointDescriptionKeySetCollection.
      GetPointDescriptionKeySets(_database)
  If keySets.Contains(name) Then
    Return keySets(name)
  End If
  Return keySets.Add(name)
End Function
```

Once we have our description key set, we can use it to add some keys. Adding a 
key is a simple as calling the `Add()` method in the `PointDescriptionKeySet` 
object. This method will also fail if the specified name/code already exists, 
so you want to check for it first.

**C#**

```csharp
private ObjectId createDescriptionKey(
  PointDescriptionKeySet keySet, string code)
{
  if (keySet.Contains(code))
  {
    return keySet[code];
  }
  return keySet.Add(code);
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
Private Function createDescriptionKey(keySet As PointDescriptionKeySet,
    code As String) As ObjectId
  If keySet.Contains(code) Then
    Return keySet(code)
  End If
  Return keySet.Add(code)
End Function
```

We created the key; now, we are going to customize other parameters. The 
`customizeDescriptionKey()’` method takes the `PointDescriptionKey` object to 
customize, the name of the point style, the name of the label style, and the 
format we would like to use for the “full description”.

**C#**

```csharp
private void customizeDescriptionKey(PointDescriptionKey key,
  string pointStyle, string labelStyle, string format)
{
  key.StyleId = getPointStyle(pointStyle);
  key.LabelStyleId = getPointLabelStyle(labelStyle);
  key.Format = format;
  key.ApplyStyleId = true;
  key.ApplyLabelStyleId = true;
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
Private Sub customizeDescriptionKey(key As PointDescriptionKey,
    pointStyle As String,
    labelStyle As String,
    format As String)
  key.StyleId = getPointStyle(pointStyle)
  key.LabelStyleId = getPointLabelStyle(labelStyle)
  key.Format = format
  key.ApplyStyleId = True
  key.ApplyLabelStyleId = True
End Sub
```

You want to insure that you turn on the `ApplyStyleId` and `ApplyLabelStyleId` 
in the `PointDescriptionKey` object; otherwise, the style and label will be set, 
but the representation will be read from the actual point object.

### Quick Trick to Access Styles by Name

In this post, I am using a little trick possible because of the Extension 
Methods feature supported in .NET. Extension Methods were introduced in .NET 3.5 
and are a very helpful feature for .NET languages that allow to extend the 
interface of an object when you do not have access to the implementation. In 
this case, I am adding an extension method `GetStyle()` to the implementation of 
`IEnumerable<ObjectId>`, which allows me to write the following code:

**C#**

```csharp
private ObjectId getPointStyle(string name)
{
  return _civildoc.Styles.PointStyles.GetStyle(name);
}

private ObjectId getPointLabelStyle(string name)
{
  return _civildoc.Styles.LabelStyles
    .PointLabelStyles.LabelStyles.GetStyle(name);
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
Private Function getPointStyle(name As String) As ObjectId
  Return _civildoc.Styles.PointStyles.GetStyle(name)
End Function

Private Function getPointLabelStyle(name As String) As ObjectId
  Return _civildoc.Styles.LabelStyles.
    PointLabelStyles.LabelStyles.GetStyle(name)
End Function
```

This is possible because of the implementation of `ObjectIdEnumerableExtensions`, 
which is shown in the following snippet.

**C#**

```csharp
internal static class ObjectIdEnumerableExtensions
{
  public static ObjectId GetStyle(this IEnumerable<ObjectId> ids, 
    string name)
  {
    foreach (ObjectId id in ids)
    {
      StyleBase style = id.GetObject(OpenMode.ForRead) 
        as StyleBase;
      if (style.Name == name)
      {
        return id;
      }
    }
    return ObjectId.Null;
  }
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
Module ObjectIdEnumerableExtensions
  <System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extension()> _
  Public Function GetStyle(ids As IEnumerable(Of ObjectId),
      name As String) As ObjectId
    For Each id As ObjectId In ids
      Dim style As StyleBase =
        TryCast(id.GetObject(OpenMode.ForRead), StyleBase)
      If style.Name = name Then
        Return id
      End If
    Next
    Return ObjectId.Null
  End Function
End Module
```

### Testing Our Command

The full implementation defines a second command `CDS_CreateCivilDevPoints`,
which is very similar to what we already saw in COGO Point Basics. As always, 
you can download the full code from the 
[Civilized Development repository](https://bitbucket.org/IsaacRodriguez/civilizeddevelopment) 
at Bitbucket to refresh your memory.

Let’s run the `CDS_CreateCivilDevDescriptionKeys` command. Once the command 
completes, you will see that a new description key set is created and that it 
contains two description keys.

![desciption key in prospector](/img/2012/jp08-prospector.png)

Now, execute the command `CDS_CreateCivilDevPoints`. In the command, we create a 
total of 20 points; 10 of them should match the ‘TREE’ description key, and the 
other 10 the ‘WELL’ key. In ‘Prospector’, select the Points node. You will see 
the following result.

Civil 3D, by default, creates a description key set “Civil 3D”, which exposes a 
key that matches “TR*”. The points added with a description of “TREE MAPLE” 
match the default description key in Civil 3D, and the one we added is ignored. 
Civil 3D exposes functionality to modify the search order of key sets when 
matching descriptions keys, and so does the API. Let’s modify our command to 
force our new description key to be searched first. For that, we implement a 
`createOrRetrieveDescriptionKeySetAndForce()` method that manipulates the order.

**C#**

```csharp
private ObjectId createOrRetrieveDescriptionKeySetAndForce(string name)
{
  PointDescriptionKeySetCollection keySets =
    PointDescriptionKeySetCollection
      .GetPointDescriptionKeySets(_database);
  ObjectIdCollection searchOrder = keySets.SearchOrder;
  if (keySets.Contains(name))
  {
    return keySets[name];
  }
  ObjectId newKeySetId = keySets.Add(name);
  searchOrder.Insert(0, newKeySetId);
  keySets.SearchOrder = searchOrder;
  return newKeySetId;
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
Private Function createOrRetrieveDescriptionKeySetAndForce(
    name As String) As ObjectId
  Dim keySets As PointDescriptionKeySetCollection =
    PointDescriptionKeySetCollection.
      GetPointDescriptionKeySets(_database)
  Dim searchOrder As ObjectIdCollection = keySets.SearchOrder
  If keySets.Contains(name) Then
    Return keySets(name)
  End If
  Dim newKeySetId As ObjectId = keySets.Add(name)
  searchOrder.Insert(0, newKeySetId)
  keySets.SearchOrder = searchOrder
  Return newKeySetId
End Function
```

The `PointDescriptionKeySetCollection` class exposes a property `SearchOrder` 
that returns the object ids of the key set in the order they will be searched. 
By inserting the new key set at the beginning of the collection, we can modify 
the search order. Notice that the `ObjectIdCollection` returned by the 
`SearchOrder` property is what we call a disconnected collection, which means 
that a new instance is created when the property is accessed. What this means to 
you is that just calling `keySets.SearchOrder.Insert(0, newKeySetId);` will not 
work and the search order will not be modified. You must first get the 
collection, then insert the object id at the beginning, and then set the 
property again as in the example above.

### Some Final Thoughts

When working with description keys, you may write a couple of different types of 
applications. Some applications will want to read and work with any description 
keys and description key sets the drawing contains. In those cases, you want to 
write very generic code and allow your users to use the functionality of Civil 
3D to create and manipulate behavior related to description keys.

Other applications will work with description keys under their own standard. In 
those cases, you want to make sure you don’t create conflicts with other 
possible description keys and description key sets. Prefix your key set names so 
that they are unique to your application. Do the same with your description key 
codes. Depending on your requirements this may not always be possible, but try 
to follow those guidelines everywhere you can.
