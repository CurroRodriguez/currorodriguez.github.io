Jay Peak provides some enhancements to the ‘ProfileView’ object. One of them is 
the ability to create multiple profile views at once. The code is very simple, 
since it is just one straight call to a static method of ‘ProfileView’. Yet, it 
is a very powerful call since it takes a `MultipleProfileViewsCreationOptions` 
object that allows to customize the behavior of the profile views being created. 
The following code shows how to create multiple profile views.

**C#**

```csharp
private void createProfileViews()
{
  ProfileView.CreateMultiple(_alignmentId, _insertionPoint,
    _creationOptions);
}

private MultipleProfileViewsCreationOptions _creationOptions
{
  get
  {
    MultipleProfileViewsCreationOptions options =
      new MultipleProfileViewsCreationOptions();
    options.DrawOrder = ProfileViewPlotType.ByRows;
    options.GapBetweenViewsInColumn = 1000;
    options.GapBetweenViewsInRow = 1000;
    options.MaxViewInRowOrColumn = 3;
    options.StartCorner = 
      ProfileViewStartCornerType.UpperLeft;
    return options;
  }
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
Private Sub createProfileViews()
  ProfileView.CreateMultiple(_alignmentId, _insertionPoint,
    _creationOptions)
End Sub



Private ReadOnly Property _creationOptions() As MultipleProfileViewsCreationOptions
  Get
    Dim options As New MultipleProfileViewsCreationOptions()
    options.DrawOrder = ProfileViewPlotType.ByRows
    options.GapBetweenViewsInColumn = 1000
    options.GapBetweenViewsInRow = 1000
    options.MaxViewInRowOrColumn = 3
    options.StartCorner = ProfileViewStartCornerType.UpperLeft
    Return options
  End Get
End Property
```

We use an alignment id, an insertion point, and the 
`MultipleProfileViewsCreationOptions` object to create the multiple views. The 
`MultipleProvileViewsCreationOption` object allows you to customize the draw 
order of the profile views, and things like the gap between rows and columns, 
maximum views in each row or column (depending on the draw order option), and 
the start corner to which the insertion point refers. The `CreateMultiple` 
method provides other overloads that allow you to customize further how the 
views are created.

You can download the entire implementation of the command from the [Civilized 
Development](https://bitbucket.org/IsaacRodriguez/civilizeddevelopment) 
repository at BitBucket.
