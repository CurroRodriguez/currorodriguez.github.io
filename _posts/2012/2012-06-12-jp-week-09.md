Point groups is an important, powerful feature of Civil 3D. In Jay Peak, we have 
exposed an API that allows you to work with the point groups in a drawing. You 
can create them, modify them, and delete them as you please, and in this post, 
we will look at the basics of working with point groups.

### Creating Point Groups

The point groups in a drawing are exposed through the `PointGroups` property in 
the `CivilDocument` class, which returns a `PointGroupCollection` object. 
Creating a point group is a simple as invoking the `Add` method in the 
`PointGroupCollection` class passing it the name of the new point group. Of 
course, you want to insure the point group doesn't already exists. The following 
command creates a couple of point groups.

**C#**

```csharp
CommandMethod("CDS_CreateCivilDevPointGroups")]
public void CDS_CreateCivilDevPointGroups()
{
  using (Transaction tr = startTransaction())
  {
    createPointGroup("Trees", "TREE*");
    createPointGroup("Wells", "WELL*");
    tr.Commit();
  }
}

private void createPointGroup(string name, 
  string includeRawDescription)
{
  if (_pointGroups.Contains(name))
  {
    return;
  }
  ObjectId groupId = _pointGroups.Add(name);
  StandardPointGroupQuery query = new StandardPointGroupQuery();
  query.IncludeRawDescriptions = includeRawDescription;
  PointGroup group = groupId.GetObject(OpenMode.ForWrite) 
    as PointGroup;
  group.SetQuery(query);
  // NOTE:    Setting a description throws an exception. The
  //          issue is being researched by the API team.
  // group.Description = "Set a description";
}

private PointGroupCollection _pointGroups
{
  get
  {
    return _civildoc.PointGroups;
  }
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
<CommandMethod("CDS_CreateCivilDevPointGroups")> _
Public Sub CDS_CreateCivilDevPointGroups()
  Using tr As Transaction = startTransaction()
    createPointGroup("Trees", "TREE*")
    createPointGroup("Wells", "WELL*")
    tr.Commit()
  End Using
End Sub

Private Sub createPointGroup(name As String,
    includeRawDescription As String)
  If _pointGroups.Contains(name) Then
    Return
  End If
  Dim groupId As ObjectId = _pointGroups.Add(name)
  Dim query As New StandardPointGroupQuery()
  query.IncludeRawDescriptions = includeRawDescription
  Dim group As PointGroup =
    TryCast(groupId.GetObject(OpenMode.ForRead), PointGroup)
  group.SetQuery(query)
  ' NOTE:     Setting a description throws an exception. The
  '           issue is being researched by the API team.
  ' group.Description = "Set a description";
End Sub

Private ReadOnly Property _pointGroups() As PointGroupCollection
  Get
    Return _civildoc.PointGroups
  End Get
End Property
```

The code checks for the existence of a point group with the specified name. If 
it doesn’t exist, it creates the point group. Creating a point group doesn’t do 
much; you will at least want to set a query that selects some points to be 
included in the point group. We will take a closer look at point group queries 
in a future post; for now, we will just use a ‘StandardPointGroupQuery’, and we 
will set its ‘IncludeRawDescriptions’ property to a specified value.

**Note**: Robert Zrnc has reported an issue setting the `Description` property 
of the `PointGroup` class.We are currently investigating the issue, and we will 
try to provide a fix as soon as possible. In the meantime, there is a workaround 
using the COM API. Of course, you will have to reference the COM API interops in 
your project.

**C#**

```csharp
AeccPointGroup comPointGroup = group.AcadObject as AeccPointGroup;
comPointGroup.Description = "Set a description";
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
Dim comPointGroup As AeccPointGroup = TryCast(group.AcadObject, AeccPointGroup)
comPointGroup.Description = "Set a description"
```

The `AcadObject` property of the `PointGroup` returns the COM instance of the 
object. This allows you to set the description property.

### Controlling Draw Order

We saw how the `PointDescriptionKeySetCollection’` exposes a `SearchOrder` 
property that allows us to control the search order in which description keys 
will be applied. Point groups allow us to override certain properties of the 
contained points, which affect how points are drawn, and since a point may 
belong to several point groups, we need to control the draw order of the point 
groups. This is done through the `DrawOrder` property of the `PointGroupCollection` 
class. The following command reverses the order in which point groups are drawn.

**C#**

```csharp
[CommandMethod("CDS_ReversPointGroupDrawOrder")]
public void CDS_ReversPointGroupDrawOrder()
{
  ObjectIdCollection drawPriority = _pointGroups.DrawOrder;
  ObjectIdCollection reversed = new ObjectIdCollection();
  for (int i = drawPriority.Count - 1; i >= 0; i-- )
  {
    ObjectId current = drawPriority[i];
    reversed.Add(current);
  }
  _pointGroups.DrawOrder = reversed;
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
<CommandMethod("CDS_ReversPointGroupDrawOrder")> _
Public Sub CDS_ReversPointGroupDrawOrder()
  Dim drawPriority As ObjectIdCollection = _pointGroups.DrawOrder
  Dim reversed As New ObjectIdCollection()
  For i As Integer = drawPriority.Count - 1 To 0 Step -1
    Dim current As ObjectId = drawPriority(i)
    reversed.Add(current)
  Next
  _pointGroups.DrawOrder = reversed
End Sub
```

Like the `SearchOrder` property of the `DescriptionKeySetCollection`, the 
`DrawOrder` property returns a “disconnected” collection, which means that you 
cannot manipulate the collection directly. You either need to get it first, make 
the changes, and set it; or create a new `ObjectIdCollection` that sets the 
desired order and set it in the `PointGroupCollection`.

### Accessing Points in a Point Group

The `PointGroup` object exposes a `GetPointNumbers()` method that returns an 
array of `uint` values representing the points in a point group. When working 
with the points in a point group (especially, if we want to use them for bulk 
operations), we will want to get the object id of a point instead of its number. 
The `CogoPointCollection` class exposes a `GetPointByPointNumber()` method that 
returns the object id for a specified point number. The following command 
renumbers the points in a point group.

**C#**

```csharp
CommandMethod("CDS_RenumberPointsForGroup")]
public void CDS_RenumberPointsForGroup()
{
  string pointGroupName = getPointGroupName();
  if (pointGroupName == String.Empty)
  {
    return;
  }

  int baseNumber = getNewBaseNumber();
  if (baseNumber == _kNoNumber)
  {
    return;
  }

  renumberPointsForGroup(pointGroupName, baseNumber);
}

private void renumberPointsForGroup(string groupName, int baseNumber)
{
  using (Transaction tr = startTransaction())
  {
    ObjectId pointGroupId = getPointGroupIdByName(groupName);
    PointGroup group = pointGroupId.GetObject(OpenMode.ForRead)
      as PointGroup;
    renumberPoints(group, baseNumber);
    tr.Commit();
  }
}

private ObjectId getPointGroupIdByName(string groupName)
{
  return _pointGroups[groupName];
}

private void renumberPoints(PointGroup group, int baseNumber)
{
  uint[] pointNumbers = group.GetPointNumbers();
  int firstNumber = (int)pointNumbers[0];
  int factor = baseNumber - firstNumber;
  _civildoc.CogoPoints.SetPointNumber(
    ToEnumerableObjectId(group.GetPointNumbers()), factor);
  group.Update();
}

private IEnumerable<ObjectId> ToEnumerableObjectId(uint[] numbers)
{
  foreach(uint number in numbers)
  {
    yield return _civildoc.CogoPoints
      .GetPointByPointNumber(number);
  }
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
<CommandMethod("CDS_RenumberPointsForGroup")> _
    Public Sub CDS_RenumberPointsForGroup()
      Dim pointGroupName As String = getPointGroupName()
      If pointGroupName = [String].Empty Then
        Return
      End If

      Dim baseNumber As Integer = getNewBaseNumber()
      If baseNumber = _kNoNumber Then
        Return
      End If

      renumberPointsForGroup(pointGroupName, baseNumber)
    End Sub

Private Sub renumberPointsForGroup(groupName As String,
                                   baseNumber As Integer)
  Using tr As Transaction = startTransaction()
    Dim pointGroupId As ObjectId = getPointGroupIdByName(groupName)
    Dim group As PointGroup =
      TryCast(pointGroupId.GetObject(OpenMode.ForRead), PointGroup)
    renumberPoints(group, baseNumber)
    tr.Commit()
  End Using
End Sub

Private Function getPointGroupIdByName(groupName As String) _ 
    As ObjectId
  Return _pointGroups(groupName)
End Function

Private Sub renumberPoints(group As PointGroup, baseNumber As Integer)
  Dim pointNumbers As UInteger() = group.GetPointNumbers()
  Dim firstNumber As Integer = CInt(pointNumbers(0))
  Dim factor As Integer = baseNumber - firstNumber
  _civildoc.CogoPoints.SetPointNumber(
    ToEnumerableObjectId(group.GetPointNumbers()), factor)
  group.Update()
End Sub

Private Function ToEnumerableObjectId(numbers As UInteger()) _
    As IEnumerable(Of ObjectId)
  Dim points As List(Of ObjectId) = New List(Of ObjectId)
  For Each number As UInteger In numbers
    Dim id = _civildoc.CogoPoints.GetPointByPointNumber(number)
    points.Add(id)
  Next
  Return points
End Function
```

The command converts the point numbers to object ids, so it can use the 
`SetPointNumbers()` method in the ‘CogoPointsCollection’ to renumber the points. 
Notice how we need to call `Update()` in the point group after we renumber the 
points. This is because the points are renumbered through the points node 
(`CogoPointCollection`) in the drawing and not through the point group itself.
